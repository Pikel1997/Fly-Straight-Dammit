# fly-straight-dammit
The fly straight dammit sequence which when plotted, initially seems chaotic, but after six hundred thirty eight iterations, instantly stabilizes
For every choice of initial term a(0) 
there exist integers r and t >= 0 
such that a(2*r+4*t+0) = 1, a(2*r+4*t+1) = 2*r+4*t+3, 
a(2*r+4*t+2) = 2*(2*r+4*t+3), a(2*r+4*t+3) = 2. - [Ctibor O. Zizka](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Ctibor_O._Zizka)
